##### LINUX :

Check distribution if packages exist or from source.

$ python gpicsync-GUI.py

GPicSync requires:
- Python2.5 or above
- exiftool
- wxpython for the GUI (2.8 but it could maybe work with a previous version)
- python-imaging (from version 0.93 of GPicSync)
- python-unidecode
- Google Earth (for Google Earth features). The Google-earth folder must in your home folder.

If you prefer the command-line version (or if you can't have the right wxpython for your distro):

$ python gpicsync.py --help

GPicSync also embeds two great free software tools (thanks to their authors):
- EXIFtool from Phil Harvey
- GPSBable from Robert Lipe
